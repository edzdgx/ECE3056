Problem 1B
----------
Total execution time:
CPU = 1: 67.6s
CPU = 2: 35.8s
CPU = 4: 33.5s

Execution time decreases as number of CPU increases, not linearly, but exponentially.
Because with 2+ CPUs, different threads are mostly at idle state.

Problem 2B
----------
B.1 Because in real life situations, context switches will be invoked more often,
    due to misses.
B.2 
Total execution time:
CPU = 1: 283.1s
CPU = 2: 106.4s
CPU = 4: 0.4s
LRTF with 4 CPUs has the lowest execution/waiting time. Because the execution time is
decreasing exponentially with LRTF as number of CPUs goes up.

Problem 3B
----------
800ms:
# of Context Switches: 99
Total execution time: 67.6 s
Total time spent in READY state: 389.9 s
